/**
 * Worker ⇄ gateway HTTP protocol contract (TypeBox).
 *
 * Single source of truth for the device/connector-worker job protocol:
 * `POST /api/workers/poll`, `/api/workers/complete`, `/complete-action`,
 * `/complete-embeddings`, `/complete-automation`, `/complete-chat`,
 * `/emit-auth-artifact`, `/poll-auth-signal`, `/stream`, and the chrome-action
 * dispatch.
 *
 * Before this module the wire shapes were typed twice with no compiler link:
 *   - the SERVER, inline as `c.req.json<{…}>()` in `worker-api/*` handlers, and
 *   - the WORKER, as hand-written interfaces in
 *     `connector-worker/src/daemon/client.ts`.
 * A field added on one side and missed on the other was a silent protocol
 * mismatch. Both sides now derive their COMPILE-TIME types from the schemas here
 * (the worker re-exports the `Static<>` types; the server annotates its
 * `c.req.json<T>()` bodies with them), so the type checker enforces agreement.
 * These are TypeBox schemas, so a future pass can also validate request bodies
 * against them at runtime — this change only wires the shared types, not
 * runtime validation.
 *
 * INVARIANT — Workers never receive real credentials (see AGENTS.md). The
 * `credentials` / `connection_credentials` on `PollResponse` carry only
 * placeholders / proxied grants the gateway chose to expose; this contract does
 * not change that boundary, it only types what already crosses it.
