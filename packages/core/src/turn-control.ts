 * Turn control policy: whether an inbound message steers the turn already

 *
 * Shared by every lane that can have a turn in flight — the agent worker, which
 * holds the running child process, and the gateway producer that dispatches an
 * isolate turn to a fleet worker it cannot address directly. One message gets
 * one answer whichever lane is running it, which is the whole point of putting
 * the predicates here rather than beside either dispatcher.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and depends only on the wire payload. Both lanes
 * import it from the `@lobu/core` barrel; an isolate guest that ever needs it
 * must reach it another way, since the barrel drags the logger and its Node
 * transports into a bundle.
