/**
 * The media tools WITHOUT the Node filesystem.
 *
 * The package root composes `file-port-node.ts`, whose Node port owns
 * `node:fs` and `node:path` for the whole package. That is correct for the subprocess lane
 * and fatal for the isolate one: an isolate bundle that names a Node builtin
 * is rejected outright by `assertIsolateEligible`, and a bundler cannot
 * tree-shake a CommonJS `require` out of the graph just because the value is
 * unused.
 *
 * So the isolate lane imports THIS entry point instead. Same tools, same
 * schemas, same implementations — only the Node composition is missing, and a
 * caller here supplies its own `filePort` in its place. The two entry points
 * share every module that matters, so nothing is duplicated to get one of them
 * portable.
