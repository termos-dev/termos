/**
 * The turn's memory hooks: recall before the model runs, capture after it
 * answers, from `@lobu/plugin-memory` itself.
 *
 * GUEST code, so the same portability rules as `workspace.ts` apply: no `node:`
 * import, no host module, no root `@lobu/core` import.
 *
 * Nothing here reimplements a hook. `createMemoryPlugin` is the SAME function
 * the subprocess lane composes, so the recall query, the `<lobu-memory>` block
 * the model reads, the capture's shape and its 2,000-character bound are
 * identical on both lanes. Two things are supplied here:
 *
 *  1. The INVOKER. The subprocess lane passes `callMcpTool` from
 *     `@lobu/plugin-mcp`, which imports the `@lobu/core` root and therefore
 *     cannot load in an isolate. This lane passes the guest's own MCP caller
 *     instead — the same `POST {gateway}/mcp/lobu/tools/{name}` under the same
 *     bearer that every other tool call on this turn takes, so there is still
 *     ONE credential and ONE host.
 *
 *  2. The SETTLE. `agentEnd` starts the `save_memory` write and returns
 *     without waiting, which is correct on a runtime that outlives the turn and
 *     silently lossy on one that does not: this isolate is disposed the moment
 *     `runAgentTurn` resolves. `runTurnMemory` therefore awaits the plugin's
 *     `settle()` before returning, so the capture actually reaches the gateway.
