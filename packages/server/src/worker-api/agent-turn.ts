/**
 * Completion for an agent turn run.
 *
 * A shadow turn reports what the isolate produced and stops there: the
 * conversation's reply still comes from the subprocess lane, so nothing is
 * delivered. What it writes is the transcript the turn produced, onto the run
 * row, which is how the two lanes are compared while the shadow runs.
 *
 * An authoritative turn additionally delivers: it appends the turn to the
 * conversation's transcript snapshot and publishes the `thread_response` the
 * client is waiting on, both inside the same fenced terminal transition, the
 * way `device-chat.ts` does for the other non-subprocess lane. Which of the
 * two a run is, is the run's own `turn.shadow`, stamped by the producer.
 *
 * `sweepStaleAgentTurnRuns` is the same distinction applied by the stale-run
 * reaper: a worker that crashes mid-turn never reaches this route, so the
 * reaper terminalizes the run and, for an authoritative turn, delivers the
 * error the completion route would have.

 * ends; an authoritative turn has a client blocked on its reply, and the
 * completion route that would have answered it never fires for a worker that
 * died. Without this the client waits forever with no error ever surfacing.
 *
 * Shape and reason follow `sweepStaleDeviceChatRuns`: candidates are read
 * once, then each is terminalized in its own transaction by an UPDATE that
 * re-asserts the full predicate, so a worker whose heartbeat or completion
 * wins after the candidate read makes this a no-op instead of an overwrite.
 * The `thread_response` joins the same transaction, and the listener is woken
 * only after commit.
 *
 * Delivery follows the run's own envelope, exactly as the completion route
 * does: a shadow turn (`turn.shadow === true`) delivers nothing, and so does a
 * run with no `reply` address — there is nowhere to deliver to, and the row
 * still terminalizes so the lane cannot wedge.
