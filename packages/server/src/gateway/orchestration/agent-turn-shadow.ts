/**
 * Shadow producer for the agent-turn isolate lane.
 *
 * A selected agent's turn is enqueued TWICE: once the ordinary way, to the
 * subprocess worker that answers the conversation, and once as an `agent_turn`
 * row the connector-worker fleet claims and runs inside an isolate. The shadow
 * copy is observational — its reply is written to its own run row by
 * `/api/workers/complete-agent-turn` and never reaches the client — so the two
 * lanes can be compared on live traffic before the isolate lane becomes
 * authoritative.
 *
 * Three things this producer must NOT do, each of which would corrupt the real
 * turn rather than merely observe it:
 *
 *  - Arm a turn-timeout marker. The marker is keyed
 *    `(deploymentName, messageId)` and discharged first-writer-wins, so a
 *    second marker for the same turn would let the shadow's outcome terminate
 *    the client's stream.
 *  - Write an `agent_run_input` journal row. Same key, same collision: a
 *    replay would resume the wrong lane.
 *  - Use a run type inside `LOBU_RUN_TYPES`. `agent_turn` is deliberately
 *    outside it, so `RunsQueue` never claims or completes these rows.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort. `enqueueAgentTurnShadow` never throws into
 * the enqueue path, and the caller runs it AFTER the real message is on the
 * worker queue, so a shadow that cannot be produced costs the turn nothing.
 *
 * Selection is the operator env var `LOBU_ISOLATE_TURN_SHADOW_AGENTS`
 * (comma-separated agent ids, or `*`). It is an operator switch for a
 * short-lived overlap, not a product surface, so it is deliberately not an
 * agent column.
